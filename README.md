# Blackhawks

We've only just begun.

This repo was created on 30th August 2024. It's a Blazor based Chicago Blackhawks fan site. Right now it's very basic and just a fe whours effort has gone into it. 
Over the next week or so I plan to extend it into an example of what a good commercial Blazor site should look like.


# Projects
Blackhawks - the web site
BlackhawksDataManager - a WPF for managing the data on the website.
